Games which I made while learning C# and Unity Engine

Hey there,

This repo contains the many games which I built with Unity Engine. I took a [course](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/learn/v4/) by [Ben Tristem](https://www.udemy.com/user/bentristem/) at udemy.

The games in this repo are inspired from the ones taught in the course. 

**Note:** I have edited the games. Therefore, you might feel that the games are slightly or very different from the ones shown at the [course](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/learn/v4/).

## Current Games

1. **Text101:** This is a very basic game which covers a story in an interactive way. The user can make actions with the help of keyboard. If you're a beginner, this game might help you to get started with Unity.

2. **NumberWizard (WIP):** This game is similar to 'guessing the number' game which we all know. The computer thinks of a number and the user has to guess that number. The user can also set the maximum number of guesses. If you're a beginner, this game might help you to get started with Unity.

3. **BlockBreaker (WIP)**

## Upcoming Games
