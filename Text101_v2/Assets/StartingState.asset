  storyText: 'Festers, Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.

    Ar least 1- of them guarding the hangar door.

    Typical.


    Could try punching my ass through. Or sneaking the long way to the emergency exit.


    What should I do?

    1. Take them head on - rush the 10 guards.

    2. Sneak my way to the emergency exit.'
